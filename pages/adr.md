Underreporting of adverse drug reactions by healthcare personnel is a common problem of many pharmacovigilence programs. Paper-based methods of reporting adverse drug reactions cases, which are tedious and prone to data errors, have been charted as one of inhibiting factors for underreporting. HakikiDawa Research team leveraged on the ICTs proliferations to digitize the process of reporting and handling the adverse drug reactions events. Through a user centered and agile software development methods, an Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) Reporting System was developed. The development was a result of several technical meetings between CIVE researchers and TFDA (IT Department and Clinical Trials Department staff). The architecture of the ADR reporting system adheres to the international ADR reporting guidance issued by the WHO. Adverse events and medication errors are coded to terms in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology.

The ADR reporting system has five modules:

* **Mobile and Web Reporting Tools**: That enables healthcare professionals (such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses and others) and consumer  to voluntarily report issues​ ​regarding quality of medical drugs, medication errors and adverse reactions.

* **Back-end submodule**: This module allows TFDA to receive and perform causality assessment on the reported cases,generate reports, perfom preminarly data analysis. It further  provide a dashboard for the TFDA ​staff ​to manipulate the ADR reports and perform informed decision on medical safety surveillance​.

* **Data exchange submodule**: The implementation of the data exchange standard provided by WHO to automate the submission of
the ADR reports from TFDA to WHO to avoid re-entry of data.

The ADR reporting system underwent rigorous testing through organized training workshops in
March 2016. The workshops targeted prospective system users including RMOs, DMOs, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, other health professionals and non-professional users residing in Dar es Salaam, Mtwara and Mwanza regions. The regions were identified for system piloting. The training was followed by extensive capacity building programs to health professionals in five regions of Tanzania (Kagera, Tanga, Arusha, Manyara and Lindi). The general evaluation of the ADR reporting system shows wide acceptance by the stakeholders and the scale up of the project is deemed to receive acceptance. The developed ADR reporting system is envisaged to strengthen the existing pharmacovigilance system by advocating an active rather than passive monitoring system of pharmacovigilance in Tanzania. Furthermore, ADR system encourages reporters by providing them with prompt feedback to motivate them to report more. It is therefore expected that once the system is launched, the rate of reporting adverse drug reactions will sharply rise.
